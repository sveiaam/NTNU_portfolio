'''
We chose some specific rotations to better show off that the protein folding code worked
To chose randomly, we would write something like:

import random
num = random.randint(1, SIZE)
clockwise = random.randint(0, 1)

Inserting num and clockwise as parameters for the protein twist, then generating some new num and
clockwise, and inserting them again.
